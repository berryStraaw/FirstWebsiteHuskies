<h2>Characteristics</h2>
<p>Huskies are extremely energetic and athletic which is the main reason
 why it is not the best breed for first time dog owners. They show signs
 of high inteligence, they like to be independent and do their own thing
 if nobody is there to controll them. They have a double coat which 
protects them from harsh winters, if they are in a warmer climate they 
tend to shed their undercoat. Their coat also protects them from the sun
 as their skin is not designed to handle sunlight. Average weight ranges
 between 16kg and 27kg, Height 50-60cm</p>

<h2>Husky activities</h2>
<p>Huskies are usually used in sled pulling competitions, but there are other activities where they can be seen, <br><i>Bikejoring</i> is an activity where a dog is running along a person on a bike sometimes even pulling him/her.<br><i>Carting</i> is similar to sled pulling expect it is done on dry land with a cart on wheels<br><i>Skijoring </i>
 same as sled pulling with some rules changed, mainly the owners do not 
have to bring a full backpack with them so it looks more like skiers 
with dogs pulling them</p>
